<h1>Stack Overflow Survey Analysis (tentative title)</h1>
<h2>By: Irvin Low</h2>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> The
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data" style="target":"_blank">dataset</a>
 comes from Kaggle.com, and is the results from a survey done by StackOverflow to determine
the background and preferences of StackOverflow members. The data was published in 2017 and consists of over 35,000 entries.<p/>
<h2>Question 1: Does the degree level obtained correlate with the job seeking status of the surveyed person? </h2>
<script src="d3.v4.min.js"></script>
<script src="main.js"></script>
<script src="venn.js"></script>
<div id='myTooltip' ></div>
<svg class="first">
</svg>
<p> The chart compares people's degree level obtained and current job seeking status.
The color represents the job seeking status of each bar segment.
The size is relative to the actual amount of people and log^2 scaled (base e), whereas the number indicates the percentage within the degree level group.
Hovering over a bar will show the degree level, job seeking status, and the actual number of people in each category. <p>
<h2> Analysis </h2>
<p>  
What this graph shows though, is that among the surveyed people the four largest groups of people using StackOverFlow are those with Master's/Bachelor's Degree, some college, or
 secondary school education. The percentage between each group is pretty close, especially between those actively looking for a job, which means among those surveyed there is a 
 large amount of people with some form of higher education still actively looking for a job.
The bar chart was chosen because it is a good way to depict the differences in sizes between the 9 groups (degree level) and the 4 subgroups.
There is a large amount of people who filed NA in this graph, for my next analysis I want to look at why people selected "NA" or "Actively seeking job" as their job seeking status.
</p> 
<h2>Question 2: Of those who are not actively looking for a job, what are their employment statuses?</h2>

<p class="tree1">
	<div class="treeselect">
	<label><input class="p0" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p0')" checked > Secondary School </input></label>
	<label><input class="p1" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p1')"> Some college </input></label>
	<label><input class="p2" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p2')"> Bachelor's </input></label>
	<label><input class="p3" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p3')"> Doctoral </input></label>
	<label><input class="p4" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p4')"> Masters' </input></label>
	<label><input class="p5" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p5')"> Professional </input></label>
	<label><input class="p6" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p6')"> Primary/Elementary School </input></label>
	<label><input class="p7" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p7')"> Prefer not to answer </input></label>
	<label><input class="p8" id="checkBox" type="checkbox" autocomplete="off" onclick="treeonclick('p8')"> No formal edu </input></label>

	</div>
</p>
<p> 
The treemap chart depicts filtered data (no longer includes "not actively seeking a job") from the previous question with a new measure, their employment status.
The size of the rect shows a quick comparison of size of each group. The number represents the actual percentage of the groups' total.
The color represents the Job seeking status of each rectangle.
</p>
<h2> Analysis </h2>
<p>
For each of the degree levels, a huge majority are employed in some form, and hence are not looking for a job.
For those with degree's they are almost twice as likely to be employed and not looking for a job.
We also see that in the groups who have obtained some form of degree education that the second largest group are those looking for a job, despite already having some full time employment.
I chose a treemap for this because treemaps shows both how the "NA" group is larger than the "actively seeking job" and the size between each employment status.
The total number of people doesn't need to be represented visually since we are only interested in looking at one specific degree level at a time.
For the next visualization I want to see job seeking status in relationship to major.
</p>
<h2> Question 3: How many of those searching for a job have majors related to computer?</h2>
<p class="notabargraph"></p>
<p>
This Venn diagram shows the amount of people in a given major, (primarily focusing on majors related to computers) and how many are still looking for a job. 
This includes people who's job seeking status is "actively looking for work" or employment status is "not employed, but looking for work"
The size represents the number of people within a given major/looking for work. Overlapping area between major and job seeking is the amount of people looking for work in the given major.
The color represents the the different majors, and hovering over the circles and overlapping area will tell you the amount of people within the given set as well as percentages.
</p>
<h2> Analysis </p>
<p>The visualization shows that roughly 10% of those in the given major are still looking for jobs.
This is particularly bad for those in CS majors, because while only 10% of people in the CS major are actively looking for jobs, that makes up 50% of the people who are looking for jobs.
In other words, theres a huge amount of competition for CS majors.
Of course, the data is only from people who use StackOverFlow, and we are assuming difference in major sizes stays consistent.
I chose a Venn diagram for this visualization, because it fits well with comparing the size of majors and those searching jobs for jobs, as well as showing the overlaps.
Next, I want to check programming experience of those looking for jobs.
</p>
<h2> Question 4: How does the years of experience programming relate to job-seeking status?</h2>
<p class="linegraph"></p>
<p>
The linegraph shows two lines, those seeking a job in blue, and those who are not in an orangeish color.
The axis, the years of experience (lower bound), is the lower end of the number of years the surveyed person has done programming.
Hovering over the points will show the job seek status, years of exp, and number of people.</p>
